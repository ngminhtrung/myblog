## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 📝 Diagrams with Kroki & PlantUML

Markdown code fences with the `plantuml` language are rendered as inline SVGs during `astro build` using [Kroki](https://kroki.io/). By default the site calls the hosted service, but you can point the renderer at any Kroki-compatible server by setting `KROKI_SERVER_URL`.

**Use the hosted service (default)**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Use a local Kroki container**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 yuzutech/kroki
KROKI_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run build
```

The env var works both locally and in CI workflows, making it easy to switch between the public service and a self-hosted instance when network access is restricted.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
